# Alzheimers-Detection
Deep learning project for early Alzheimer’s detection using brain MRI scans. Includes preprocessing, CNN &amp; transfer learning models (Inception-ResNetV2), evaluation metrics, and Grad-CAM for explainability.
# Motivation and Objective
​​​The primary motivation behind this project is to leverage deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for the early and accurate detection of Alzheimer’s disease using brain MRI scans. Alzheimer’s is a progressive neurodegenerative disease where early diagnosis can significantly improve patient care and treatment planning. The objective is to build a robust classification system capable of automatically distinguishing between MRI scans of healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer’s disease. This project aims to achieve a classification accuracy of at least 98%, along with sensitivity and specificity of at least 95%, by combining diverse MRI datasets, applying data preprocessing and augmentation, optimizing CNN architectures, and utilizing interpretability methods such as Grad-CAM to ensure clinical relevance.
